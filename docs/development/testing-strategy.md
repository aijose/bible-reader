# Testing Strategy

## Testing Approach

### Manual Testing (Primary)
Given the application's focus on user interaction and content accuracy, manual testing forms the core testing strategy.

### Automated Testing (Secondary)
Limited automated testing for data processing scripts and utility functions.

## Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Data Processing Validation

#### Bible Text Processing
- [ ] All 27 NT books processed correctly
- [ ] Verse count matches expected (7,957 total)
- [ ] No missing or duplicate verses
- [ ] Text encoding handled properly (UTF-8)
- [ ] Special characters preserved
- [ ] Book metadata accurate (genres, chapter counts)

#### Commentary Processing
- [ ] Matthew Henry commentary linked correctly
- [ ] John Gill commentary linked correctly
- [ ] Preview text generates properly (200 chars)
- [ ] Theological tags applied consistently
- [ ] Source attribution maintained
- [ ] No orphaned commentary sections

#### Cross-Reference Validation
- [ ] Traditional references compiled accurately
- [ ] Reference types categorized correctly
- [ ] Weights applied appropriately
- [ ] No circular or invalid references
- [ ] Thematic groupings make sense

### Phase 2: Embedding Quality

#### Embedding Generation
- [ ] All verses have embeddings (384 dimensions)
- [ ] Vector normalization applied correctly
- [ ] No NaN or infinite values
- [ ] Embedding model consistency
- [ ] File size within acceptable limits

#### Similarity Matrix
- [ ] Cosine similarity calculations accurate
- [ ] Top 5 results per verse generated
- [ ] Similarity threshold (>0.3) applied
- [ ] Reference weights integrated properly
- [ ] Performance targets met

### Phase 3: React Application

#### Core Functionality
- [ ] Bible text displays without formatting issues
- [ ] Text selection detects verse boundaries
- [ ] Single verse selection enforced
- [ ] Commentary loads for selected verses
- [ ] Related passages appear within 500ms
- [ ] Navigation between chapters works
- [ ] Book selection functions properly

#### User Interface
- [ ] Clean, readable text layout
- [ ] Selection indicator appears on text selection
- [ ] Sidebar slides out smoothly
- [ ] Commentary sections expand/collapse
- [ ] Related passages display with context
- [ ] Mobile layout stacks appropriately

#### Performance
- [ ] Initial load under 3 seconds (broadband)
- [ ] Selection-to-commentary under 500ms
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console
- [ ] Smooth scrolling and interactions
- [ ] Memory usage reasonable

### Phase 4: Integration Testing

#### End-to-End Workflows
- [ ] Select verse → see commentary → navigate to related passage
- [ ] Browse through chapters maintaining commentary context
- [ ] Switch books without losing functionality
- [ ] Refresh page maintains state appropriately
- [ ] Back/forward browser navigation works

#### Cross-Browser Testing
- [ ] Chrome (desktop & mobile)
- [ ] Firefox (desktop & mobile)
- [ ] Safari (desktop & mobile)
- [ ] Edge (desktop)

#### Mobile Testing
- [ ] Touch selection works reliably
- [ ] Sidebar doesn't interfere with reading
- [ ] Text remains readable on small screens
- [ ] Navigation controls are accessible
- [ ] Performance acceptable on mobile networks

### Phase 5: Production Readiness

#### Deployment Testing
- [ ] Build process completes without errors
- [ ] Static files serve correctly
- [ ] Routing works in production environment
- [ ] HTTPS deployment functions properly
- [ ] CDN caching works as expected

#### Offline Functionality
- [ ] App works offline after initial load
- [ ] localStorage caching functions
- [ ] Graceful handling of network failures
- [ ] Service worker (if implemented) works correctly

## Testing Tools and Methods

### Manual Testing Tools
- Browser Developer Tools
- React Developer Tools
- Lighthouse for performance auditing
- Mobile device testing (real devices preferred)

### Automated Testing (Limited)
```javascript
// Data processing validation
- JSON schema validation
- Verse count verification
- Reference link validation
- Embedding dimension checks
```

### Performance Testing
- Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Lighthouse scores (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices)
- Network throttling simulation
- Bundle size analysis

## Bug Tracking

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- Data corruption or missing verses
- Commentary mislinked to wrong verses
- Performance under 500ms target
- JavaScript errors preventing functionality

### Important Issues (Should Fix)
- UI/UX improvements
- Mobile responsiveness issues
- Loading state improvements
- Error message clarity

### Nice-to-Have Issues (Could Fix)
- Performance optimizations beyond targets
- Additional accessibility features
- Enhanced mobile interactions
- Visual polish improvements

## Success Criteria Validation

### Functional Success
- [ ] Select any NT verse → get relevant commentary
- [ ] Related passages appear within 500ms
- [ ] Commentary from both sources displays correctly
- [ ] Related passages show appropriate context
- [ ] Mobile interface remains usable

### Technical Success
- [ ] Initial load under 3 seconds on broadband
- [ ] Selection-to-commentary under 500ms
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in normal usage
- [ ] Works offline after initial load
- [ ] Data integrity maintained

### User Experience Success
- [ ] Intuitive text selection process
- [ ] Commentary provides meaningful insight
- [ ] Related passages feel genuinely connected
- [ ] Navigation between chapters is smooth
- [ ] Sidebar doesn't interfere with reading flow

This testing strategy ensures the application meets all requirements while maintaining high quality and performance standards.
