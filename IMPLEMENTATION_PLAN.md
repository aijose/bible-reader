   - Show full text for ≤5 verses, reference only for longer passages
   - Implement passage type indicators (semantic, direct, thematic)
   - Always display when verse is selected (independent of commentary)

3. **Genre-Aware Processing**
   - Implement different processing for biblical genres:
     - Gospels: Emphasize parallel passages, Jesus's teachings
     - Epistles: Focus on doctrinal connections
     - Prophecy: Highlight fulfillment patterns
     - Historical: Context and cultural background

### Deliverables
- Scalable RAG system supporting 1,681+ verses
- Real-time related passage discovery
- Multi-source result integration
- Genre-specific processing logic

### Success Criteria
- Related passages computed on-demand under 100ms
- Results combine semantic similarity (0.3+ threshold) with cross-references

- `utils/textSelection.js`: Selection handling and verse boundaries

### Data Files
- `bible_asv.json`: ASV text structured by book/chapter/verse
- `commentaries.json`: Verse-linked commentary from both sources

- `cross_references.json`: Traditional reference chains
- ~~`similarity_matrix.json`~~: Removed for scalability (was O(n²))

## Embedding Approach Evolution

### Original Approach (Unscalable)
The initial implementation used a precomputed similarity matrix approach:
- **Method**: Generate embeddings for all verses, then compute similarity between every verse pair
- **Storage**: `similarity_matrix.json` with precalculated scores
- **Complexity**: O(n²) storage and generation time
- **Problem**: For n verses, requires n×(n-1)/2 similarity calculations
- **Scaling**: 1,681 verses = 1.4M+ similarity pairs, 27,000 verses = 365M+ pairs

### Current Approach (Scalable)
Redesigned for linear scalability using on-demand computation:
- **Method**: Store only embeddings, compute similarities when needed
- **Storage**: `embeddings.json` with 384-dimensional vectors per verse
- **Complexity**: O(n) storage, O(n) per query computation
- **Implementation**: Real-time cosine similarity in `ragSystem.js:findRelatedPassages()`
- **Optimization**: Query result caching (LRU, 100 queries) + 0.3 similarity threshold
- **Scaling**: Linear growth - supports full NT (27,000 verses) without memory issues

### Technical Details
- **Model**: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- **Embedding Size**: 384 dimensions per verse
- **Similarity Function**: Cosine similarity with L2 normalized vectors
- **Performance**: <100ms per query, <5MB embedding data
- **Coverage**: 1,681 verses across Matthew, John, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, partial Revelation
